# Plotter_Investigation
![The thing itself](/images/portrait.jpg?raw=true)

Investigation materials for exploring, understanding, and designing a new interface for a mysterious hand-made xy plotter found in a surplus store.

Initial Breakdown:
-Device is precision xy plotter designed for manual and digital input.

-Positioning is accomplished using two DC control motors (TODO: specs). Documentation for these motors isn't available.

-Each motor is equipped with an integrated analog tachometer.

-Unsure if tachometer reading is being used anywhere. Would the reading be useful if encoder assumption is correct?
  
-Each motor has a set of 5 leads in addition to normal dc motor wiring. Assumption is that these leads are from some kind of encoder.

-Unsure if encoders are absolute or relative.
